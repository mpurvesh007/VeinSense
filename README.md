# VeinSense Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and details for the VeinSense project, developed as part of the MSc Data Science dissertation. The project focuses on vein detection in dorsal hand images, utilizing both image processing and deep neural networks. Below are the details and instructions for each method and the associated files.

## Method 1: Image Processing

### Files

1. `Method_1_Image_Processing_Code.py`
   - Script for vein detection using image processing.
   - Reads an input dorsal hand image and highlights veins.
   - Implements adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and color mapping.

2. `Method_1_SSIM_IOU_Metrics_Code.py`
   - Script for calculating SSIM and IOU metrics.
   - Requires the dilated image generated by `Method_1_Image_Processing_Code.py`.
   
3. `Method_1_SSIM_IOU_Scatterplot.py`
   - Script for creating scatterplots of SSIM and IOU scores.
   - Input: SSIM and IOU scores obtained from `Method_1_SSIM_IOU_Metrics_Code.py`.

### Instructions

- Run `Method_1_Image_Processing_Code.py` to generate a dilated image.
- Use the dilated image for SSIM and IOU metric calculations with `Method_1_SSIM_IOU_Metrics_Code.py`.
- Plot scatterplots with `Method_1_SSIM_IOU_Scatterplot.py`.

## Method 2: Deep Neural Network

### File

1. `Method_2_Deep_Neural_Network.py`
   - Utilizes ResNet-18, ResNet-34, VGG-16, and VGG-19 architectures.
   - Model weights can be downloaded from the provided links:

     - [RESNET-34](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aa8wrkmwakAADhZ8wDiJBkw7q9LTNzsx/view?usp=drive_link)
     - [VGG-16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdB3HRV0JeIaKr9d3AYkvvPG2Fo5fOvF/view?usp=drive_link)
     - [VGG-19](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6UN5QBXsU60xFb0tQzhnNHY5ewwANZD/view?usp=drive_link)

### Instructions

- Change the `BACKBONE` variable on line 56 to select the desired model.
- Model weights can be downloaded from the provided Google Drive links.

## Streamlit Application

### File

1. `streamlit_final.py`
   - Streamlit application for vein detection.
   - Allows users to upload images and visualize results using both methods.

### Instructions

- Run the Streamlit application using `streamlit run streamlit_final.py`.
- Upload dorsal hand images for vein detection and analysis.

## Dataset

- The project utilizes the dorsal hand vein dataset by Wilches-Bernal, available [here](https://github.com/wilchesf/dorsalhandveins).
